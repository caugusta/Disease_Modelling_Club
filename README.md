# Disease_Modelling_Club
Welcome to the Disease Modelling Club tutorial on epidemic classification. 

If you're looking for the presentation slides, look under 'DMC_Presentation.pdf'
If you're looking for the Python tutorial, head to 'Disease_Modelling_Club_Apr_19_2018.ipynb'. To make this work, you will need to downloaded 'train_data.csv' and 'test_data.csv', and have installed Python (and the necessary packages including TensorFlow and Keras) on your computer. How to accomplish this is system-dependent. If you are a member of the Disease Modelling Club, you should have received an email from Melanie and/or Rachael indicating some general steps. Alternatively, I recommend starting here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos.
