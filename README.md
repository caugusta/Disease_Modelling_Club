# Disease_Modelling_Club
Welcome to the Disease Modelling Club tutorial on epidemic classification. 

If you're looking for the presentation slides, look under 'DMC_Presentation.pdf'.

If you are a member of the Disease Modelling Club, you should have received an email from Melanie and/or Rachael indicating some general steps for installing Python.

To run the tutorial:

- download Disease_Modelling_Club_Apr_19_2018.ipynb, train_data.csv and test_data.csv and save to your Desktop or some easy-to-remember location
- install Python (I recommend starting here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)
- install required packages (TensorFlow and Keras) via the commands (one at a time in the command line):

  pip install tensorflow --user
  
  pip install keras --user
  
- in the command line:

cd /place/to/where/you/saved/the/ipynb/file

- in the command line:

jupyter notebook

- click on Disease_Modelling_Club_Apr_19_2018.ipynb

You should be able to run each cell of the notebook by hitting shift+Enter on a mac, or by clicking Cell -> Run All. If you run into issues, try looking for a solution here: http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html
